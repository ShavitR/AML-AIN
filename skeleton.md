# AML-AIN Skeleton TODO List

This checklist covers everything needed to establish a minimal, end-to-end skeleton for the AML-AIN project. Each item should be completed with at least a stub, placeholder, or mock implementation, so the system can run and data can flow through all major modules.

## General
- [ ] Project builds and runs end-to-end (even with mock data)
- [ ] All major modules are connected (frontend ↔ backend ↔ agents ↔ knowledge graph ↔ communication ↔ DB)
- [ ] Minimal integration tests for end-to-end flow

## Frontend
- [ ] App shell loads and displays basic UI
- [ ] Navigation between main views (Dashboard, Agents, Jobs, Knowledge, Logs, Settings)
- [ ] Fetch and display mock data from backend (e.g., agent list, job list, system metrics)
- [ ] Form stubs for agent registration, job submission, and knowledge query
- [ ] Error/loading/empty states for all main views

## Backend / Orchestrator
- [ ] Express (or equivalent) server runs and responds
- [ ] API route stubs:
  - [ ] /api/health (returns mock health)
  - [ ] /api/agents (list, register, mock data)
  - [ ] /api/jobs (submit, status, mock data)
  - [ ] /api/knowledge/query (returns mock data)
- [ ] In-memory or mock DB for agents, jobs, knowledge
- [ ] Orchestrator logic stubs for job decomposition, scheduling, assignment
- [ ] Logging and error handling stubs

## Agent Framework
- [ ] Base agent class/interface exists
- [ ] At least one agent stub (e.g., DemoAgent) that can receive and acknowledge messages
- [ ] Agent registration and heartbeat stubs
- [ ] Agent can process a mock job/task

## Knowledge Graph
- [ ] KnowledgeGraphService class exists
- [ ] Database stub (in-memory or mock)
- [ ] API for basic query (returns mock data)
- [ ] Ingestion/validation stubs
- [ ] Versioning and conflict resolution stubs

## Communication Layer
- [ ] Message types and protocol definitions
- [ ] Message serialization/deserialization stubs
- [ ] Message routing stub (routes messages between modules)
- [ ] Message queue stub (in-memory or mock)
- [ ] Communication manager stub

## Infrastructure
- [ ] Dockerfile(s) for all services
- [ ] docker-compose.yml to run skeleton stack
- [ ] Basic Kubernetes manifests (optional for skeleton)
- [ ] .env.example with required environment variables

## Database
- [ ] Mock or in-memory DB for all modules (agents, jobs, knowledge, etc.)
- [ ] DB connection/config stubs
- [ ] Migration/init scripts (can be empty or mock)

## APIs & Integration
- [ ] All planned API endpoints exist (even if return mock data)
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger stub (optional for skeleton)
- [ ] WebSocket or SSE stub for real-time updates

## Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Basic logging in all services (console.log or equivalent)
- [ ] Health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Mock metrics endpoint (e.g., /api/metrics)

## CI/CD & Tooling
- [ ] Basic test runs in CI (even if just "hello world")
- [ ] Linting and formatting checks
- [ ] README and docs reference skeleton status

**Tip:** Mark each item as complete as you implement the corresponding stub or placeholder. Once all are checked, your skeleton is ready for vertical slice development!
