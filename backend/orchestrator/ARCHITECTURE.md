# AML-AIN Orchestration Framework Architecture

## Overview
The AML-AIN Orchestration Framework is responsible for managing the lifecycle of distributed AI tasks, decomposing complex jobs, scheduling and assigning work to agents, monitoring execution, and ensuring reliability and scalability across the system.

## Orchestration Pattern
- **Pattern:** Centralized orchestrator with distributed agents
- **Rationale:** Centralized control enables global optimization, easier monitoring, and simpler coordination. Agents are stateless workers that execute assigned tasks and report status/results.

## Responsibilities
- Accept and validate job submissions
- Decompose jobs into tasks and subtasks
- Resolve dependencies between tasks
- Select and assign agents for each task
- Schedule tasks based on policies and resource availability
- Monitor task and agent status
- Handle failures, retries, and recovery
- Collect metrics and logs for observability
- Expose APIs for job submission, status, and control
- Provide a UI/dashboard for monitoring and management

## Non-Responsibilities
- Direct execution of AI/ML workloads (delegated to agents)
- Low-level resource management on agent hosts
- Data storage for large datasets (handled by storage services)

## Interfaces & Contracts
- **Agent Interface:**
  - Task assignment messages (task spec, input, parameters)
  - Status and result reporting
  - Heartbeat/health checks
- **Communication Layer:**
  - Message queue for task dispatch and status updates
  - Pub/sub for events and notifications
- **API Interface:**
  - REST/gRPC endpoints for job submission, status, control
  - WebSocket for real-time updates
- **UI Interface:**
  - Dashboard for orchestration status, task queue, agent assignments, logs

```

- The orchestrator receives jobs from users/clients via API/UI.
- It decomposes jobs, schedules tasks, and assigns them to agents via the communication layer (message queue).
- Agents execute tasks and report status/results back to the orchestrator.
- The orchestrator monitors progress, handles failures, and updates the UI/dashboard.

## Next Steps
- Define TypeScript/JavaScript types for core orchestration entities (Task, Subtask, Job, AgentAssignment, etc.)
- Scaffold orchestrator service code structure
- Implement task decomposition and scheduling logic
